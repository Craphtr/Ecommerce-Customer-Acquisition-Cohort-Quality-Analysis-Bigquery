## 🚀 Key Cohort Metrics

| KPI | Metric Description | Badge |
|-----|--------|-------|
| 📊 Average days to 2nd purchase | Measures activation speed — how quickly new customers become repeat buyers after first purchase. Lower = healthier onboarding and engagement. | ![Days to 2nd purchase](https://img.shields.io/badge/Days%20to%202nd%20purchase-3.03%25-blue) |
| 🔄 Repeat Purchase Rate | Percentage of customers who purchase more than once. Primary indicator of early retention and cohort health. | ![Repeat Purchase Rate](https://img.shields.io/badge/Repeat%20Rate-42%25-green) |
| 🏆 Percentage of One-time Buyers | Share of customers who never return after first purchase. Direct signal of activation failure and revenue leakage. | ![One-time Buyers](https://img.shields.io/badge/One%20buyers-83.7%25-lightgrey) |
| 🥇 Users Activated Within 7 days | Portion of customers making a second purchase within one week — measures strong early engagement momentum. | ![Users within 7 days](https://img.shields.io/badge/Within%207%20days-87%25-yellow) |
| ⚪ Users Activated Within 30 days | Coverage of successful activation window; shows whether customers eventually convert even if not immediately | ![Users within 30 days](https://img.shields.io/badge/Within%2030%20days-97%25-silver) |
| 🟤 High-Value Customer Share | Percentage of customers reaching high behavioral value tiers based on purchase frequency and engagement. Indicates cohort quality | ![High-Value Tiers](https://img.shields.io/badge/Platinum%20Gold-30.3%25-brown) |

## Overview

This project investigates **customer acquisition effectiveness** and **cohort quality deterioration** for an ecommerce business using the Google Analytics 4 (GA4) public BigQuery dataset.

Rather than relying on revenue (obfuscated in GA4 sample data), this analysis applies a **behavioral definition of customer value**, replicating how product analytics teams diagnose acquisition performance under **imperfect real-world data constraints**.

**Objective:** Answer three acquisition-stage business questions:

1. Which acquisition channels bring **high-value customers**?  
2. How do **customer characteristics evolve over time**?  
3. Why are **newer customer cohorts deteriorating** despite stable acquisition strategy?  

---

## Business Context

Ecommerce companies frequently observe:

- Increasing customer acquisition volume  
- Stable marketing strategy  
- Declining customer quality  

This creates a critical ambiguity:

> Is acquisition failing, or are customers failing to **activate after acquisition**?

This project demonstrates a structured analytical workflow to **isolate the true driver**.

## Dataset

**Source:** [Google Analytics 4 Obfuscated Ecommerce Dataset (BigQuery Public Data)](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/bigquery-public-data/ga4-obfuscated)  

**Characteristics:**

- Event-level ecommerce tracking  
- 3 months of observable acquisition cohorts  
- Revenue values anonymized (near zero)  
- Partial channel attribution  
- No explicit CAC data  

**Analytical Constraint:**  

Because monetary metrics are obfuscated, **customer value must be inferred using behavioral proxies**, mirroring real industry scenarios involving **privacy loss and incomplete attribution**.

## Data Modeling

A **customer-level analytical layer** (`customer360`) was constructed from event data.  

**Customer Grain:** One row per customer  

**Core Fields:**

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `customerId` | Unique user identifier |
| `cohort_date` | Month of first purchase (use truncated timestamp) |
| `channel_group` | First acquisition channel |
| `total_orders` | Lifetime purchase count |
| `avg_order_value` | Mean order value proxy |
| `value_tier` | Behavioral customer tier |

**Metric Definition: Behavioral Customer Value**  

Because revenue is obfuscated, customer value is defined using **engagement and purchasing behavior**.

**Value Indicators:**

- `avg_orders_per_customer`  
- `repeat_purchase_rate`  
- `pct_one_time_buyers`  
- `value tier distribution`  
- `time to second purchase`  

**High-value customers** are those who:

- Purchase again  
- Purchase quickly  
- Exhibit higher order frequency  

---

## Analysis 1 — Acquisition Channel Quality

**Business Question:** Which channels bring **high-value customers**?  

**Metrics:**

- Customers acquired  
- `avg_orders_per_customer`  
- `repeat_purchase_rate`  
- Value tier distribution  
- `pct_one_time_buyers`  

**Key Finding:**  
Channel performance differences were minimal.

**Implication:**  
Acquisition source was **not the primary driver** of customer quality decline.

**Visualization:**

## Analysis 2 — Cohort Evolution

**Business Question:** How do **customer characteristics change over time**?  

Customers were grouped by **first purchase month**.

**Metrics Examined:**

- Repeat purchase rate  
- Average order frequency  
- Value tier migration  
- Acquisition mix stability  

**Finding:**  
Later cohorts demonstrated:

- Higher one-time buyer share  
- Lower repeat behavior  
- Reduced engagement depth  

Customer quality **degraded progressively** after acquisition.

## Analysis 3 — Cohort Deterioration Diagnosis

**Business Question:** Why are cohorts deteriorating despite **stable acquisition strategy**?  

**Diagnostic Dimensions:**

- **Acquisition Stability:** Channel mix remained largely constant  
- **Behavioral Change:** Time to second purchase increased, repeat purchase probability declined  
- **Activation Failure:** Customers increasingly failed to transition beyond first purchase  

**Core Insight:**  
The business problem is **not acquisition efficiency** — it is an **early lifecycle activation breakdown**. Marketing optimization alone would **not solve performance decline**.

## Key Takeaways

- Behavioral metrics are essential when revenue is obfuscated  
- Cohort analysis reveals early activation failures that traditional channel KPIs cannot detect  
- Structured, repeatable workflows enable rapid diagnosis of customer quality issues  
- Visualizations should track **metrics across time**, not just across channels
